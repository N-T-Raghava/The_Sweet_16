# The_Sweet_16
This project detects faces in real-time from a webcam feed or an uploaded image and predicts age (in bins of 5 years) and gender (Male/Female). The model is based on OpenCVâ€™s Deep Neural Network (DNN) module and pre-trained models for face, age, and gender detection.
For running this model correctly on your computer, change the base directory location in the app.py file and run it!
# Disclamer! 
Don't change the location of the files inside the project file, download the whole project zip file and use it.
The values of age and gender given in the output are based on a open cv model, it might not give accurate results.
